The R-code in this project is not sophisticated, however it got the job done. Follow these steps to recreate my results: 

1. Download the csv-documents, save them in your directory, and be sure to open them and hide the title 'Tabell 1' in each csv-file. 
2. Save the csv files and the map 'valgeografi' in your directory.
3. Insert the r-code from DATAFRAME to R and adjust all of the 'read.csv'-code for your directory. 
4. Insert the code from ANALYSIS.

The PDF for the final draft of the B.Sc will shortly be uploaded as a pdf.
