The code in this project is not very edited and not very sophisticated, however it got the job done. Follow these steps to recreate my results: 
1. Download the csv-documents and be sure to open them and hide the title 'Tabell 1' in each csv-file. 
2: Save the csv file in a directory and insert the r-code from DATAFRAME. 
3: Adjust all of the 'read.csv'-code for your directory. 
4: Insert the code from ANALYSIS.

The PDF for the final draft of the B.Sc will shortly be uploaded as a pdf.
